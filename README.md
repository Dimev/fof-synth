# Simple FOF synthesizer
Written in rust.
This is for me to experiment with this synthesis technique because it's a quite cool one

### Goals
 - Don't require multiple FOF pulses to be computed at the same time
 - Be fast
 - try and fit within [-1, 1] sample amplitude

### Licence
The unlicense, do what you want with this
